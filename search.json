    "title": "Ethical Open Science Curated Reading List",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Ethical Open Science for Past Global Change Data RCN is a network of archaeologists, paleoecologists and information scientists seeking to advance the Quaternary data ecosystem by further aligning key data repositories with the FAIR principles of scientific data governance and CARE principles of Indigenous data governance. In doing so, we hope to enact ethical open science.\nHere we present a reading list, collated from our monthly reading group and other sources, which introduces Quaternary scientists to a wide-ranging literature on research data lifecycles, the FAIR and CARE principles and their instantiation in Quaternary science projects, and the relationship between scientific data and social power. Our intention in compiling this list is not to be comprehensive. Rather, we hope to highlight some good jumping-off points that can suffice as primers on these topics and also facilitate deeper dives. Our RCN does not necessarily endorse any particular claim made by the authors of the papers presented here. We view these readings rather as works of serious scholarship which will challenge their readers to better understand their own relationship to FAIR, CARE, and ethical open science.\nWe have placed ten modules in a sequence which you may choose to follow, or you can target just those weeks which are of particular interest to you. We encourage the exploration of these topics in a group setting with active discussion, but we think individual contemplation of these papers will also prove productive.\nIf you have any questions about this reading list, please reach out to Nick Hoffman (hoffmanick@gmail.com).",

What sorts of factors might influence one’s decision to contribute to a specialist repository as opposed to a generalist repository like Zenodo?\nHow have the repositories described in these readings attempted to implement CARE? Where have they made the most progress and what are the biggest challenges?\nWhat special affordancess does a repository have in diffusing data ethical norms, both within its own organizational structure and for the other entities (i.e., data uploaders and funders) with whom the repository interacts?",

How are archaeologists and ecologists supposed to move toward Open Science within their disciplines?\nNeither Hampton et al. (2015) nor Marwick et al. (2017) explicitly mention the FAIR or CARE principles, yet we posit that there is a relationship between those principles and Open Science which should be recognized. How might FAIR and CARE be supportive of the mission of Open Science?",
